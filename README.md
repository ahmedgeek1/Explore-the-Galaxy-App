# Explore-the-Galaxy-App
This application will calculate the speed of an interstellar spacecraft as it accelerates though our galaxy to explore the stars.  The spacecraft is using a new engine technology that continues to accelerate over time with no limit, allowing the spacecraft to reach distant areas of the galaxy at record speed.  The spacecraft starts out slowly, but for each day it accelerates, it will double the speed it has attained prior to that point.  The spacecraft will accelerate from 0 MPD (Miles Per Day) at launch to 1000 MPD by the end of the first day, and will have covered 500 miles (average speed of (0 + 1000)/2= 500).  At the end of day two, it will be up to 2000 MPD (double day one's speed), and will have covered 2000 miles total (the previous day’s 500 miles plus the new day’s average of (1000+2000)/2)).  Create an app that allows the user to enter the number of days the spacecraft has been traveling and your app will tell the user what the speed of the spacecraft is (in MPD) at the end of that day.  Your app will also calculate the total distance traveled by the spacecraft to the end of that day  Create a form with the appropriate controls to get the user input and display the answers correctly.  Ensure you do proper data validation so that any mistakes the user makes entering data do not crash the program or create/allow strange results.
